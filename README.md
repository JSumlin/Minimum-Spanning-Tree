# Minimum-Spanning-Tree
  Creates vertices with random integer coordinates between 0, inclusive, and 500, exclusive. Finds the manhattan distance between each point,
and uses it as the weight for the edges between points. All of these edges are added to a min-heap. Then uses Kruskal's algorithm to find
the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Depth first search is utilized to ensure a cycle is not formed in the spanning tree.
